# RandomQuoteMachine
Random Quote Machine for freeCodeCamp part of the Front End Libraries Certification.
This is a simple project using HTML, JAVASCRIPT and BOOTSTRAP.
As the name suggests it's a simple page that displays a quote and its author.
It has a button that changes the quote (refreshing the page has a similar effect) and 
a button that enables the ability to share the quote on twitter.
